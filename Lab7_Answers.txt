		    Lab 7 - Rotary Encoders and Interrupts

Edit the document below to fill in your answers to the review problems at the
end of the assignment web page.


1. (2 points) TIMER1 is to be used to output a 50% duty cycle signal
(squarewave) for tone generation as was done in this lab.  For the two tones
specified below, determine a prescalar, the OCR1A value, and the number of
interrupts to allow before stopping the timer.  Your answer for the prescalar
and OCR1A values should be the ones that give the most accurate timing.

a. 200 Hz tone for 5 seconds

	prescalar: 1
	OCR1A: 40,000
	num interrupts: 2000

b. 32 Hz tone for 2 seconds

	prescalar: 8
	OCR1A: 31,250
	num interrupts: 128

2. (1 point) Briefly explain why updating the LCD display in your ISR could
lead to undesirable behavior for this lab.

	When we are in an ISR no other interrupts can occur. Since updating the 
	LCD takes a relatively long time, we may miss interrupts from the timer
	or encoder if we update the LCD in the ISR.
